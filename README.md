Adventure Land is a Browser game, and this github project is just for listing code for this game. Some of this code is not my own code, and I have not linked it. Most of the code is just modified or compiled scripts that I use and have available to other users.

So please if you find anything that is from another source, you can comment it in, and when I decide to get on github, I will attemt to update it. 

Again, most of this code IS NOT MY OWN CODE! 
Thanks for Understanding, and Do not advertise this code as your own or even attempt, unless it is your code; specificly owned by you.  

Stay cool and do not copyright code. ðŸ’¯
